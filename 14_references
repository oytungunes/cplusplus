A reference variable is a "reference" to an existing variable, and it is created with the & operator:


Now, we can use either the variable name food or the reference name meal to refer to the food variable:

string food = "Pizza";
string &meal = food;

cout << food << "\n";  // Outputs Pizza
cout << meal << "\n";  // Outputs Pizza
